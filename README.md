# Six Sigma Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## 🚀 Overview

A complete implementation of Six Sigma DMAIC methodology as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Claude Desktop. This enables AI-assisted software development with built-in quality controls and systematic process improvement.

## ✅ Current Status

**Fully Implemented and Working!** The core Six Sigma MCP server is now complete with all DMAIC phases operational.

## 🎯 Key Features

### DMAIC Phase Implementation
- **Define**: Voice of Customer (VOC) analysis, CTQ tree generation, constraint documentation, SIPOC diagrams
- **Measure**: KPI definition, baseline establishment, Measurement System Analysis (MSA)
- **Analyze**: Root Cause Analysis (RCA), Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA), statistical analysis
- **Improve**: Solution generation, evaluation, and implementation planning
- **Control**: Control plans, monitoring setup, validation, and documentation

### Quality Management
- **Phase Gate Criteria**: Automated checking of phase completion requirements
- **Quality Scoring**: Real-time quality metrics throughout the project
- **Risk Assessment**: FMEA-based risk level calculation
- **Progress Tracking**: Complete project status visibility

## 🔧 Installation

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Node.js 14+ installed
   - Claude Desktop application

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\jared\OneDrive\Desktop\SixSigmaMCP\mcp-server
   npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
   ```

3. **Configure Claude Desktop**:
   Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:
   ```json
   "six-sigma-mcp": {
     "command": "node",
     "args": [
       "C:/Users/jared/OneDrive/Desktop/SixSigmaMCP/mcp-server/six-sigma-server.js"
     ],
     "env": {}
   }
   ```

4. **Restart Claude Desktop**
## 💡 Usage Examples

### Creating a New Project
```
User: Create a Six Sigma project for a high-performance API

Claude: I'll create a Six Sigma project for your high-performance API using the DMAIC methodology.

[Creates project with requirements, budget, and timeline]
```

### Running DMAIC Phases
```
User: Execute the define phase for project proj_1234567

Claude: I'll execute the Define phase to analyze customer requirements and establish quality criteria.

[Performs VOC analysis, generates CTQ tree, documents constraints, creates SIPOC]
```

### Checking Progress
```
User: Show me the project status

Claude: [Displays current phase, completion percentage, quality score, and phase status]
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Single Server Implementation
The current implementation uses a single, comprehensive MCP server that handles all DMAIC phases. This provides:
- Simplified deployment
- Centralized state management
- Consistent phase transitions
- Integrated quality gates

### Phase Components

#### Define Phase
- **VOC Analysis**: Categorizes requirements into functional/non-functional
- **CTQ Tree**: Maps customer needs to measurable quality characteristics
- **Constraints**: Documents technical, business, and regulatory constraints
- **SIPOC**: Creates Supplier-Input-Process-Output-Customer diagram

#### Measure Phase
- **KPI Definition**: Establishes measurable metrics for each CTQ
- **Baseline Establishment**: Captures current performance levels
- **MSA**: Validates measurement system reliability

#### Analyze Phase
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Identifies underlying issues
- **FMEA**: Evaluates failure modes and calculates Risk Priority Numbers
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculates process capability and sigma levels
- **Gap Analysis**: Quantifies improvement opportunities

#### Improve Phase
- **Solution Generation**: Creates solutions based on approach (incremental/redesign/innovative)
- **Solution Evaluation**: Scores solutions on impact, effort, risk, and cost
- **Implementation Planning**: Develops phased implementation timeline

#### Control Phase
- **Control Plans**: Establishes control charts and response plans
- **Monitoring Setup**: Configures alerts and dashboards
- **Documentation**: Creates SOPs and training materials
- **Validation**: Performs comprehensive testing

## 🔍 Technical Implementation

### State Management
- Projects stored in memory (Map structure)
- Each project tracks:
  - Basic info (name, budget, timeline)
  - Current phase and phase status
  - Artifacts from each phase
  - Quality metrics and risk levels
  - Gate criteria completion

### Quality Gates
Each phase has specific criteria that must be met:
- Automatic checking via `check_phase_gate`
- Clear indication of met/unmet criteria
- Prevents progression without completion

### Metrics Calculation
- **Quality Score**: Composite of phase completion, gate criteria, and risk level
- **Risk Level**: Based on FMEA average RPN scores
- **Phase Completion**: Percentage progress through DMAIC

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### Multi-Agent Architecture
- Separate agents for each DMAIC phase
- Inter-agent communication via shared resources
- Specialized expertise per agent

### Claude Integration
- AI-powered solution generation in Improve phase
- Intelligent requirement analysis
- Automated code quality validation

### Persistence Layer
- Redis integration for state management
- Project history and analytics
- Multi-user support

### Advanced Features
- Real-time dashboards
- Predictive analytics
- Integration with development tools
- Automated testing integration
