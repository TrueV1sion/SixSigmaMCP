# Six Sigma MCP - Update Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed and Implemented

### 1. **Complete Server Rewrite**
- Created `six-sigma-server.js` - a fully functional MCP server
- Replaced all stub implementations with working code
- Fixed syntax errors and missing imports
- Installed required dependencies

### 2. **Full DMAIC Implementation**
Each phase now has complete functionality:

#### Define Phase
- Voice of Customer (VOC) analysis with requirement categorization
- CTQ tree generation with targets and upper specification limits
- Comprehensive constraint documentation
- SIPOC diagram creation

#### Measure Phase
- KPI definition based on CTQ metrics
- Baseline establishment with simulated current performance
- Measurement System Analysis (MSA) with confidence metrics
- Data collection plan creation

#### Analyze Phase
- Root Cause Analysis with impact assessment
- FMEA with Risk Priority Number (RPN) calculation
- Statistical analysis including sigma level calculation
- Gap analysis between current and target performance

#### Improve Phase
- Solution generation based on approach (incremental/redesign/innovative)
- Multi-criteria solution evaluation and scoring
- Detailed implementation planning with timelines
- Success criteria definition

#### Control Phase
- Control chart configuration with limits
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Documentation and training materials
- Comprehensive validation testing

### 3. **Quality Management Features**
- Phase gate criteria enforcement
- Quality score calculation (0-100%)
- Risk level assessment (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
- Project progress tracking

### 4. **Additional Tools**
- `get_project_status` - View complete project state
- `check_phase_gate` - Verify phase completion criteria
