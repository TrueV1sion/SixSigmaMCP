# Six Sigma MCP - Implementation Guide

## What's Been Fixed and Improved

### 1. **Complete Server Implementation**
- Replaced stub implementations with fully functional DMAIC phases
- Each phase now performs actual analysis and generates meaningful artifacts
- Proper state management and phase transitions

### 2. **Quality Gate Implementation**
- Each phase has specific criteria that must be met
- `check_phase_gate` tool validates readiness for phase transitions
- Prevents skipping critical steps

### 3. **Comprehensive Metrics**
- Quality score calculation based on multiple factors
- Risk level assessment from FMEA results
- Phase completion tracking
- Project duration calculation

### 4. **Realistic Analysis Tools**
- **VOC Analysis**: Categorizes and prioritizes requirements
- **CTQ Tree**: Maps requirements to measurable targets with USL
- **FMEA**: Calculates Risk Priority Numbers for failure modes
- **Statistical Analysis**: Provides sigma levels and DPMO

### 5. **Practical Outputs**
- Detailed status reports at each phase
- Clear next steps and recommendations
- Actionable implementation plans

## How to Use the System

### Step 1: Create a Project
```
Create a Six Sigma project for [your project description]
```

Claude will use the `create_project` tool to initialize with:
- Project name and business case
- Initial requirements
- Budget and timeline
- Deployment target

### Step 2: Define Phase
```
Run the define phase for [project_id]
```

This will:
- Analyze Voice of Customer (VOC)
- Generate Critical to Quality (CTQ) tree
- Document all constraints
- Create SIPOC diagram

### Step 3: Measure Phase
```
Execute the measure phase
```

This establishes:
- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Current baselines
- Measurement system reliability

### Step 4: Analyze Phase
```
Run the analyze phase with comprehensive analysis
```

Performs:
- Root Cause Analysis
- Failure Mode Effects Analysis
- Statistical analysis
- Gap identification

### Step 5: Improve Phase
```
Execute improve phase with innovative approach
```

Generates:
- Multiple solution options
- Evaluation and scoring
- Implementation timeline
- Success criteria

### Step 6: Control Phase
```
Complete the control phase
```

Sets up:
- Control charts and limits
- Monitoring and alerts
- Documentation
- Validation testing

## Understanding the Outputs

### Quality Metrics
- **Quality Score**: 0-100% composite score
- **Risk Level**: LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH based on FMEA
- **Phase Completion**: Progress percentage
- **Sigma Level**: Process capability indicator

### Phase Artifacts
Each phase generates specific artifacts stored in the project:
- Define: VOC analysis, CTQ tree, constraints, SIPOC
- Measure: KPIs, baselines, MSA, data collection plan
- Analyze: RCA, FMEA, statistical analysis, gaps
- Improve: Solutions, evaluation, implementation plan
- Control: Control plan, monitoring, documentation

## Advanced Features

### 1. Analysis Depth Options
For Analyze phase, specify depth:
- `basic`: Quick analysis
- `standard`: Normal depth (default)
- `comprehensive`: Detailed analysis

### 2. Solution Approaches
For Improve phase, choose approach:
- `incremental`: Quick wins, low risk
- `redesign`: Significant changes, medium risk
- `innovative`: Cutting-edge solutions, higher risk

### 3. Status Checking
- Use `get_project_status` anytime to see full project state
- Add `include_artifacts: true` to see detailed artifacts
- Use `check_phase_gate` to verify phase completion

## Best Practices

1. **Complete Each Phase**: Don't skip phases - the methodology depends on sequential completion

2. **Review Gate Criteria**: Always check phase gates before proceeding

3. **Document Requirements Thoroughly**: Better requirements lead to better CTQ trees and solutions

4. **Consider All Risks**: The FMEA helps identify potential failures before they occur

5. **Monitor Continuously**: The Control phase sets up ongoing quality assurance

## Troubleshooting

### If MCP doesn't appear in Claude:
1. Run `test-server.bat` to verify the server works
2. Check Claude Desktop developer console for errors
3. Ensure path in config matches exactly
4. Restart Claude Desktop completely

### If tools don't work:
1. Check project ID is correct
2. Verify you're in the right phase
3. Look at error messages for guidance

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Implementation**: Run through a complete DMAIC cycle
2. **Customize for Your Needs**: Modify metrics, criteria, or analysis methods
3. **Integrate with Your Workflow**: Use alongside your development process
4. **Provide Feedback**: Note what works well and what could improve

The Six Sigma MCP is now a complete, working implementation ready for production use!
